    project_description: "The world needs more diversity in coding. The #CallforCode Challenge for Black Girls CODE is calling on young leaders to use their tech skills to fight for social justice and combat climate change. Commit to the cause. Push for change. Answer the call.",

    project_duration: "1 month",
    project_goal: "This project aimed to develop a mockup of flyers and posters that depicted the primary focus of the hackathon premise: environmental changes and racial injustices, but also be able to target young black women who code to participate in the event.",
    project_process: {
      phase01: "Initially, when I started the project, I had no insight into the project's vision, nor did I have any leadership criticism to help review and critique my designs. I mocked up a 'simplistic' idea of the design and sent it to my sister, Koby Heramil, who was the program manager of the event at Black Girls Code. A couple of days later, I received critiques from Yolanda Rabun, IBM research counsel, on its overall look and message. She explained that we, as a team, should meet up to discuss the project in detail the following week.",
      phase02: "A week later, the project's lead designer, Jordan Powell, invited me to a meeting with Yolanda to discuss the current design and their expectations moving forward. Jordan and Yolanda explained the project's goal and what type of look they wanted the flyers and posters to have. After the meeting, Jordan sent me all the necessary documents and files that would help further my design process.",
      phase03: "Koby organized the meeting with Yolanda, Jordan, and me a week later. I developed three different but similar mockups for the design. Once I showed the designs to the team, they immediately praised my delivery and thoroughness, the goals and concepts needed to be addressed, and the overall design look.",
      phase04: "Jordan and Yolanda messaged me a week later, explaining the minor fixes that needed to be added to the design before deploying. After everything was finalized and critiqued, I sent over the final PSD files to Jordan and her team so they could finish the project."
    },
    project_outcome: "The flyer was uploaded on the official IBM Developer page a week before the event and, within several minutes, accrued hundreds-plus likes from their community, including from notable personalities such as Chelsea Clinton. The event was a success. In total fifty-plus applicants and twenty-plus volunteers attended the event. The event gave out prizes for the first, second, and third-place winners. IBM and Call for Code products, including shirts, hats, water bottles, pens, bags, and stickies, were given to all participants who attended the event. I felt proud of my work and the positive impact received from the message the flyer displayed. The target audience, Black girls who code, was whom I tried to influence with my message. Overall, the hackathon's premise was for applicants to develop and deploy an application that tackles either environmental changes or racial injustices. I believe that girls did precisely that.",
